            <h2>More About Sologamy</h2>
            <div>
<p>There is a concept that is growing in popularity which encourages people to adopt self-marriage in an effort to look
after the one person they will always be in a long-term relationship with – ourselves. It is called Sologamy, and
despite being born in the mind of a jilted bride, it is growing into the ultimate act of self-love that a person can
engage in – a commitment to truly loving yourself. You become your own partner.</p>
<p>You are the best person to decide how you want to be loved and treated. If you want life to have laughter, fun and
    meaning then it is up to you to make that happen. Too often we put these important values into the hands of another
    person. We get into a relationship and expect that person to make us happy, which very rarely ever happens.</p>
<p>But sologamy goes further than that because in learning to love yourself and be kind to yourself it makes it easier
    for you to spread that love and compassion to others.</p>

<h3>Unhealthy Relationships</h3>

<p>You can’t heal an unhealthy relationship by expecting the other person to change. The best, and only way, is to heal
    yourself. When you can learn to forgive your own shortcomings and imperfections it makes it easier to forgive the
    shortcomings and imperfections in other people. That doesn’t mean you condone what has happened to you or any
    actions that may have resulted in you thinking less of yourself. It just means you refuse to carry around the hurt.</p>

<h3>Sologamy for the single</h3>

<p>Sologamy is an inclusive practice. If you are single and meet someone you can still open up to be with them, there is
    no need to divorce yourself, because you will always be the ultimate primary partner to yourself. </p> <p> committed to
    your own self-love will help your relationship to grow in strength – as long as your partner understands that it is
    not about excluding them and loving yourself does not mean that you don’t love them.</p>

<h3>Sologamy for the happy</h3>
<p>You may be someone who is already happy with who they are, and self-love is a given for you. Well, a sologamy
    ceremony can support you in sharing that with the people you love. You may be enjoying a loving relationship right
    now and totally feel content or maybe you love your life right now. 
Why not enjoy the ceremony and declare it in a
    way that provides a space for others to consider living the sologamy life? Let everyone know that you know you are
    worthy of love, you deserve to enjoy happiness and that you will always do what works for you.
