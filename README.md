The Sologamy Club website was my first project. It is part of the Code Institute Full Stack Developer training.

In July 2023 the html training was updated to include how to build a website using Flexboxes so I decided to create another Sologamy website bsaed on the Code Instiute run through project.

Sologamy version two is deployed at https://todiane.github.io/sologamy-p1-v2/
